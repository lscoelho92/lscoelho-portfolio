Hello , unfortunately this github account was only used to carry out tests for companies.
During my programming career, I always used accounts provided by companies and unfortunately I don't have a private account with projects that represent me nowadays.
With that, I will be listing here the last projects I worked on explaining my responsibilities and technologies used in each of them.

The company has a dedicated portal for livestock and poultry producers with the history of all animals from birth until the product is made available in markets for the final consumer.
When this portal was created, there was no defined layout for the application. So we used Vuetify to help us develop the screens and components for this system.
